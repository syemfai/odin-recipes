    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Gnocchi (pronounced nyo-kee) is the name for round dumplings made with flour and potatoes,
       or with semolina or yellow polenta flour. They are perhaps one of the most ancient homemade
       pastas made by cutting small pieces from the dough and cooking them in boiling water. They 
       can be purchased either commercially or made artisanally.</p>
    <p>Preparing gnocchi at home is one of the techniques handed down from mother to daughter, 
        and they represent the great Italian culinary heritage. The way that flour and potatoes are 
        kneaded together to form a firm but elastic dough is part of the muscle memory of women who 
        have always performed this ancient ritual. The dough is formed into small ropes and cut into 
        pieces about an inch long. Gnocchi are boiled in plenty of salted water, drained with a 
        perforated ladle as soon as they float and then topped with a chosen sauce.</p>
