    <p>Risotto is a creamy Italian dish that tastes a lot like the rice version of mac and cheese. 
        Unlike other rice recipes that require simmering in a pot of water, risotto is cooked very 
        slowly by adding small amounts of liquid at a time. This process allows the rice to release 
        its starches, creating a rich, velvety sauce with soft but slightly al dente grains.</p>
    <p>Risotto is best enjoyed the second it comes off the stovetop; the starches begin to set as 
        you wait, affecting that saucy goodness you worked so hard to create. But don’t worry if 
        you made more than you planned, because those leftovers make one of our favorite recipes. 
        Mix the extra risotto with an egg and roll it in breadcrumbs. Fry ’em up to create delicious 
        arancini risotto balls.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>for 4 servings</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>6 cups low-sodium chicken stock, or vegetable stock</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 shallot, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 lb shiitake mushroom(455 g), stemmed and thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon fresh thyme, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups arborio rice(200 g)</li>
        <li>½ cup white wine(120 mL)</li>
        <li>1 cup grated parmesan cheese(110 g), plus more for serving</li>
        <li>¼ cup fresh parsley(10 g), for serving</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Add the stock to a medium pot and bring to a boil over high heat. 
            Once the stock is boiling, reduce the heat to low or remove the pan from the 
            heat and keep nearby.</li>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a wide, tall pot over medium heat. Once the oil begins to 
            shimmer, add the shallot and cook, stirring frequently, until translucent.</li>
        <li>Add the shiitake mushrooms and butter. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the 
            mushrooms have cooked down.</li>
        <li>Add the garlic, thyme, salt, and pepper, stir, and cook for 1 minute, until the 
            butter has melted and the garlic is aromatic.</li>
        <li>Add the rice and stir until fully coated in the mushroom mixture. Let the rice 
            toast for 1-2 minutes, until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the white wine and cook until the wine has evaporated, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Add 1 cup (240 ml) of the hot stock and stir to combine. Cook, stirring frequently, 
            until the stock is fully absorbed.</li>
        <li>Continue to add the stock, ½ cup (120 ml) at a time, stirring continuously, until the 
            broth is fully absorbed, for 15-20 minutes. Depending on how fast the rice cooks, 
            there may be leftover stock.</li>
        <li>Once the rice is al dente, remove from the heat. Add the Parmesan and stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Top with parsley, Parmesan, salt, and pepper.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
