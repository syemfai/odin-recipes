    <p>Risotto is a creamy Italian dish that tastes a lot like the rice version of mac and cheese. 
        Unlike other rice recipes that require simmering in a pot of water, risotto is cooked very 
        slowly by adding small amounts of liquid at a time. This process allows the rice to release 
        its starches, creating a rich, velvety sauce with soft but slightly al dente grains.</p>
    <p>Risotto is best enjoyed the second it comes off the stovetop; the starches begin to set as 
        you wait, affecting that saucy goodness you worked so hard to create. But don’t worry if 
        you made more than you planned, because those leftovers make one of our favorite recipes. 
        Mix the extra risotto with an egg and roll it in breadcrumbs. Fry ’em up to create delicious 
        arancini risotto balls.</p>
