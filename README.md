# odin-recipes
This repository is created for odin recipes in The Odin Project.

This website will feature a main homepage that lists out a bunch of recipes that have hyperlinks in them and it allows users to click on them.

Upon clicking on the links, which will bring them to a different webpage, they will be able to view the respective recipe of the dish.

In this lesson, I will be demonstrating my ability to parse coherent HTML code and hopefully design a cogent website that is easily readable for the users. 

*Note: CSS will not be used here and therefore the website will be lacking in flavour. Hopefully the food won't be ;)

Have a look!:
